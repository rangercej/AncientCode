What do you do with old source code? I've found I've still got a copy of
20-year old DOS-based code from my early PC coding days. Do I delete it? Do
I keep it, and if so where? Some of it can be instructive (in both the good
and bad ways).

For better or worse, I'm keeping it and uploading it here. The vast majority
are single file programs written for either Turbo Pascal or Turbo C. The
oldest code is Pascal based.

I'm going to endevour to get each one running again in DOSbox before
uploading, this way I know what I'm uploading and can catalogue it properly.
Also it's a trip down memory lane.

So please excuse any code that makes you squirm :-)
